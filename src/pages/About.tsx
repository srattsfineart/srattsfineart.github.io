            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              S. Ratts Fine Art was established in 2015 by renowned art curator Sarah Ratts, with a vision to create a space where contemporary art could be experienced in its purest form. What began as a small gallery in the heart of the art district has grown into a respected institution known for its discerning eye and commitment to artistic excellence.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Our gallery specializes in contemporary paintings, sculptures, and mixed media works that challenge conventions and inspire dialogue. We represent a diverse roster of established and emerging artists whose work demonstrates exceptional technical skill, conceptual depth, and innovative approaches to their medium.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              At S. Ratts Fine Art, we believe that art has the power to transform perspectives and enrich lives. Our mission is to make exceptional contemporary art accessible to collectors, enthusiasts, and the wider community through thoughtfully curated exhibitions, educational programs, and a welcoming gallery environment.
